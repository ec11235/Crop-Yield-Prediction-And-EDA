# Crop Yield Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building machine learning models to predict crop yields based on factors such as rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer use.

## Project Overview

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing crop yield.
- Build and evaluate regression models for predicting crop yields.
- Use polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships in the data.
- Visualize key insights and model results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning (Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
